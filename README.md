# Details about repository
This repository is for completing assignments in the course "Computer systems automated design". It contains a project for a hardware-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using Arduino Uno and C++. The game logic will primarily run on the Arduino Uno. The graphical will be developed using Qt.


# Task details
## Task 1
The primary objective of this task is to set up a repository where the default branch is develop. After that, a new branch named feature/develop/task1 should be created. In this branch, a README.md file must be added containing all required details. Furthermore, a TAG needs to be generated, followed by submitting a pull request.

## Details about the technology, programming language and hardware

### Hardware
- **Arduino Uno.**
A microcontroller board used for the hardware aspect of the project. The Arduino will handle the core game logic, such as determining the winner and managing game states. 

### Software
- **QT Creator.**
GUI Development.
- **Platformio.**
To develop and upload the logic code onto the Arduino Uno, mainly employing C/C++ for low-level management.

### Programming Languages
- **C/C++.**
Development of game logic and graphical interface.

### Communication
- **Serial Communication.** 
The Arduino will communicate with the Python application through a UART serial port to send and receive game data and inputs.
